		<p>Everyone should be able to impact their community. Political action, whether this means going to a city council meeting, attending a rally ro running for office, is an important way of creating impact. But anyone with kids can tell you that the cost of childcare can make these actions prohibitive.</p>

		<p>Politisit is here to help. We provide money for child care so that monthers, fathers, grandparents, or other child care providers can become involved without having to worry abou their kids. Just send us a request, and we'll work with you to help pay for the child care of your choice.</p>

		<p>What kind of activities can be included? Here's a brief list:
		<ul>
			<li>Attending a school board meeting</li>
			<li>Speaking at a City Council meeting</li>
			<li>Attending a rally</li>
			<li>Running for local or national office</li>
		</ul>
